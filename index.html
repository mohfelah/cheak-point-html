            <h3>Apple Computer Company</h3> was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne
            as a business partnership.The company's first product was the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built
            entirely by Wozniak.To finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation, a VW Bus,
            for a few hundred dollars, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for US$500 (equivalent to $2,381 in
            2021).Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976.The Apple I was
            sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which would not yet be
            marketed as a complete personal computer.It went on sale soon after debut for US$666.66 (equivalent to
            $3,175 in 2021).Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666,
            and that he came up with the price because he liked "repeating digits"</p>
